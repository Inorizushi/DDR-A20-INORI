# DDR-A20-INORI
A modified version of WyvernD's DDR A20 theme to target accuracy, performance issues, and missing features.

I've deleted the old repository as I've found that Sparsus's theme uses nearly my entire version of the A20 theme
as a base without crediting me, nor WyvernD. The last time this theme was worked on was July 2020.

My work is displayed on the right in the screenshots.

Before you say, "But Inori, you've stolen code before too!"
Yes, but at least I apologized and either stopped working on things, gave proper credit, or re-wrote the code used.

You could've at least credited me, but you didn't.
